"""Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA) module

The Revealed Comparative Advantage is an index introduced by Balassa (1965),
which is used to evaluate the main products to be exported by a country,
and their comparative advantages in relation to the level of world exports
(Hidalgo et al., 2007).

    It is important to note that even though the functions do not use a

    be per period; for example working with World Exports for the year 2020.
    Also, the index always has to be a geographic level.
