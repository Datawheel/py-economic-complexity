"""Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA) module

The Revealed Comparative Advantage is an index introduced by Balassa (1965),
which is used to evaluate the main products to be exported by a country,
and their comparative advantages in relation to the level of world exports
(Hidalgo et al., 2007).

    """Calculates the Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA) for a tidy-data formatted DataFrame.

    It is important to note that even though the functions do not use a
    parameter in relation to time, the data used for the calculations must
    be relative to a time period; for example, considering World Exports for
    the year 2020.

    Arguments:
        df (polars.DataFrame | polars.LazyFrame) --
            A tidy-data formatted DataFrame with the information to calculate
            the RCA values. Must contain at least qualitative columns for the
            economic activity and associated location, and a quantitative column
            with the measure to use for calculation.

    Keyword Arguments:
        activity (str) --
            The name of the column to use as economic activity.
        location (str) --
            The name of the column to use as associated location.
        measure (str) --
            The name of the column to use as measure.
        binary (bool, optional) --
            Binarize RCA values to 1 if RCA >= cutoff, or 0 if not.
            Default is `False`
        cutoff (bool, optional) --
            Defines the value to establish the binarization criteria.
            Default is `1.0`

    Returns:
        (polars.LazyFrame) --
            Tidy-data formatted RCA LazyFrame. Note both the input data and the
            output calculation is in tidy-data format.
            Remember to call `.collect()` on the resulting LazyFrame to perform
            the calculation.
